# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Project Overview

Roza was involved in research on the specific types of bacteria found in human belly buttons, to identify the best bacteria which can be used to synthesise the tastiest meat-free beef for "Impossible Beef". She wanted a dashboard to display results for each individual participating in the research.
